## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-spin-roulette.git
cd react-spin-roulette

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run dev build
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **Use strict TypeScript** - no `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- **Export all public types** - make the package fully type-safe
- **Document with JSDoc** - add comments for public APIs
- **Validate props** - add runtime validation where appropriate

### React

- **Use functional components** - no class components
- **Use hooks properly** - follow React hooks rules
- **Memoize when appropriate** - use `useMemo` and `useCallback` for performance
- **Keep components small** - single responsibility principle

### Code Style

- **Follow the existing code style** - we use Prettier and ESLint
- **Write clear variable names** - prefer descriptive over short
- **Add comments for complex logic** - explain the "why", not the "what"
- **Keep functions small** - ideally under 50 lines

### Testing

- **Write tests for new features** - aim for high coverage
- **Test edge cases** - not just the happy path
- **Use descriptive test names** - `it('should do X when Y happens')`
- **Mock external dependencies** - keep tests fast and isolated

### Commit Messages

Follow the conventional commits specification:

```
type(scope): subject

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(roulette): add support for custom easing functions
fix(hooks): resolve memory leak in useRoulette
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Test individual functions and utilities
- Mock external dependencies
- Cover edge cases and error conditions

### Component Tests

- Test component rendering
- Test user interactions
- Test prop changes
- Test callback invocations

### Integration Tests

- Test component behavior with real hooks
- Test complete user workflows
- Test accessibility features

## Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add JSDoc comments to public APIs
- Include code examples in documentation
- Update CHANGELOG.md

## Performance Considerations

- Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Use `useCallback` for callback functions passed to children
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use CSS transforms for animations (GPU acceleration)
- Keep bundle size small

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML
- Include ARIA labels where appropriate
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Test with screen readers
